<h3><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Grading Guidelines/Process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Each section of the course, representing a week and/or module, and clearly identified by title and date, includes material that you'll need to review, and work you'll need to do. This work is your homework, and unless stated otherwise is due by the end of the time period specified in the dates. Typically this is Sunday at midnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Many assignments are autograded (like quizzes and/or attendance quizzes) and other involve a simple grade, while others are peer reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Auto graded items will present a grade in the gradebook as soon as you complete them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Simple graded items will have a grade as soon as the instructor reviews them, typically after the due date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Peer reviewed items will have typically have 3 grade components: Your submission, and two peer reviews. Your submission will be worth 2/3 of the full grade, and the remainder is split between your two peer reviews. For a typical 30 point assignment that means your work is 20 points, and each peer review is 5: 20 + 5 + 5 = 30. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">At any point a single point (1) will mean that your work on that assignment is insufficient, and it willy typically be followed by feedback from your instructor on what you need to do to improve your grade. As such, you may need to do some math to sort out whether you are missing a peer review, or your original submission needs work, or some combination of the two. If you have questions about your grade, look for your three posts, and the numeric scores on each. Their SUM (all grades on all posts you'e made) should be the total. So if you have 11/20, for example, it might mean that you have a good submission, and one bad peer review and one missing peer review (10 + 1 + 0) or it could mean you have a bad submission and 2 good peer reviews (1 + 5 + 5). If you look at your submissions and their grades this should be apparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Here are most examples:<br />1 point - you submitted your work, and it needs you to make updates.<br />2 points - you submitted your work, and after the 2nd time it still needs updates<br />3 points - (same as above but 3rd time)<br />4 points - (sames as above but 4th time)<br /></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">5 points - you did a peer review but didn't submit your work<br />6 points - see (5 &amp; 1) above<br />7 points - see 2 (above) + 5&nbsp; (above)<br /></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">10 points - you did two peer reviews, but not your own work.<br />11 - see (10 + 1) above<br />12 - see (10 + 2) above</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">and so on. You can usually work out any combinations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">19 - your work is almost done, but still needs minor updates. You didn't do any peer reviews.<br />20 - your work is great, but you still need peer reviews<br /></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">24 (see 19 + 5)<br />25 (see 20 + 5)<br /></span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">30 all done - finally!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">33 - sometimes you'll get some extra credit just for finishing everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">If the scale on the assignment is greater (i.e. 60) just adjust everything accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;">Some assignments don't include peer reviews, and should say so- generally no peer assignments don't require much feedback (i.e. they are just a link to a completion screen or screenshots).</span><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"></span></p>
