<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">Netiquette literally is "net etiquette" and encompasses the arena of manners on the network/web and in this course. You can find lots of examples online, and read up in depth on the topic on <a href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sites like this</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">Here is a great article about student emails: <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay">https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">For purposes of this class, here are some guidelines:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">When emailing anyone (including your instructor) include a MEANINGFUL subject line, a salutation, good grammar and sentence structure and punctuation, and a signature. Here is a good example followed by a bad example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">GOOD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">SUBJECT: Confusion about actual due dates to each module in WEB 115.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">Dear Mr. von Briesen,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">I noticed that each part of moodle has dates on it but i don't see due dates anywhere. Can you clarify when we actually have to get work turned in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">Ashley</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">BAD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">SUBJECT: re &nbsp;(or) Ashley Wilkes (or) homework (or) confusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">When is our work due each week because i turned something in and it hasn't been graded and i'm really concerned because i have to keep a good grade to keep my financial aid and i had some trouble with understanding the course because moodle is new to me please help.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">The last email doesn't let me know what course the student is in, what the subject is, and is not really clear about what the student needs or wants from me. Don't be that person.</span></p>
<p></p>
