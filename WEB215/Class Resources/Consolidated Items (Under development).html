<h3><strong>What's with these attendance quizzes, anyway?</strong></h3>
<p>The intent of the weekly quizzes is to tell the school administration that you are "actively participating" in the course, and to do it automatically. When you take the quiz, your score is automatically moved to the gradebook, and a school application shows you as "Present" in our attendance system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the real question is, when do you want to be marked as present? If you're not on financial aid, or with the VA, it probably doesn't matter. Otherwise weekly is a good rule of thumb. Not doing anything for two weeks is bad.</p>
<p>So short answer? Do them sometime in the week that they appear - but being off by a few days (in my courses) won't hurt you.</p>

<h3>Participation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In addition to the assigned readings/tutorials, the class/instructor announcements and the class discussion forum are both required reading. While you do not have to post on the discussion forum, you are responsible for all content that is posted there, and the instructor may use the discussion forum as a standard means of communicating with the class.</p>
<p>Please take an active role in the class, both in providing the required peer reviews, but in asking questions and answering your classmates on the class discussion forum.&nbsp;</p>
