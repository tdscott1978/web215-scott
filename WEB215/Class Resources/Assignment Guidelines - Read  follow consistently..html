  <p><span style="font-size: 13.6000003814697px; line-height: 1.4;">PLEASE Make sure ALL work follows these guidelines going forward, unless you have specific reasons, and state those in your submission (i.e. it won't validate because you're using bootstrap, or there's a space because the sample code had that).</span></p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><strong>NO SPACES</strong>: Do not have any spaces in any of your file names or folder/directory names. my brand is not acceptable. my_brand is, as is mybrand, as is brand.</li> 
   <li><strong>NO UPPER-CASES</strong>: Do not have any upper-cases in any of your file/path names. WEB115 is bad. web115 is good. MyBrand is bad. mybrand is good.&nbsp;</li> 
   <li><strong>DON'T UNDERLINE NON-LINKS</strong>: If it's not a link, don't underline it, either on a forum or on your page. Underlines are for links, though links need not be underlined.</li> 
   <li><strong>MANAGE FILES WELL</strong>: Put your work in the folder for this class unless it really belongs in a subfolder. I'm seeing a lot of classwork in sub or sub-subfolders that really should be in the outer folder. File management will kick your butt, so decide where things go, and have a reason for it. Name your files well, avoiding abbreviation, and with consistency</li> 
   <li><strong>VALIDATE HTML &amp; CSS:</strong> Your pages should validate to html 5 or xhtml 1.1 and the button should match what you are validating for (i.e. don't have an xhtml button that validates html 5 and vice versa).</li> 
   <li><strong>CLEAN UP IMAGES</strong>: Don't use and image and then use HTML to resize it. Use an image editor to make it the size you want. Include the sizing in the HTML for validation, but not for resizing. Do not stretch/shrink images in a way that distorts them.&nbsp;</li> 
   <li><strong>BE CAREFUL ABOUT COPYRIGHT</strong>: Most pictures on the web are copyright and are not yours to use for any reason. Look for images that are in the public domain, or licensed with creative commons. With creative commons, show your sources.</li> 
   <li><strong>ATTENTION TO DETAIL</strong>: Look carefully at your page for little artifacts- things that look odd or don't belong. This includes things like text going off an edge, misaligned blocks, or the small line between the validation buttons because you have links underlined, and have a space between the buttons.</li> 
   <li><strong>BRAND EVERYTHING</strong>: Include more elements of your brand on each page. That means your logo, your company/organization name, and your tagline/catchphrase, as well as your theme (colors, fonts, etc...). In addition, anything you need to customize should relate to your theme. So instead of "Good Morning!" you should have "Good Morning Sweeties!" (if your theme involves candy or witches).</li> 
   <li><strong>LINK TO JS &amp; CSS</strong>: Avoid having styles or javascript within your html page. Put them in one or more linked files. If you don't, explain why in your submission.</li> 
   <li><strong>MEANINGFUL REVIEW</strong>: Your peer review should include first, something that should be fixed/improved, or affirmation about something. If you can't think of anything then make some kind of suggestion or observation that indicates you've actually tried to find problems, and have examined the page.</li>
