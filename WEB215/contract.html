<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Terrell D. Scott</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2021 Web-215 Advanced Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen. </p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on my website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
